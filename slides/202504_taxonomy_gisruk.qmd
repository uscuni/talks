## Two levels of aggregations
1. Regional ETCs to morphotopes
2. Morphotopes to a taxonomy of Morphotopes.



## Regions

# Limitations

- Even cadastral data is of very different quality, there is no consistent definition of what is a building across neighbouring countries, regions or even cities within the same country.

- The morphometric characters are limited to 2d variables, since there is only aggregte height data available that is derived and not recorded.

- Adding a temporal dimension to the analysis is difficult due to data unavailability.


# Conclusions

Multiple types of urban form in different countries and across the setttlement hierarchy are morphologically close to eachother.

---

Nevertheless the heterogeneity of urban form is present even at high levels of aggregation.

![Linear development concentration](../figures/202504_taxonomy_gisruk/poland_linear.png)

---

- The taxonomy extends existing regional and global classifications.

- The importance of elements and variables changes as we move through the taxonomy. Capturing and combining aspects of other urban form classifications.
