momepy: Urban Morphology Measuring Toolkit (Fleischmann, 2019)

<!-- 5 years ago, I wrote a software and did analysis of individual cities -->

Methodological Foundation of a Numerical Taxonomy of Urban Form (Fleischmann et al., 2021)
:::

<!-- it had issues but it proved that spatial data science can play a significant role in urban morphology -->

## 2022

::: aside
Geographical characterisation of British urban form and function using the spatial signatures framework<br>(Fleischmann and Arribas-Bel, 2022)
:::

<!-- when we later managed to scale the analysis of this sort to the whole of Great Britain, it was thanks to some optimisation on a code level but primarily thanks to complicated distributed processing. which severely hinders reproducibility and replicability. the work also focused on form & function, delineating not fully morphological areas -->

## 2024

<!-- - but the year is 2024 and we are further today
	- momepy and a lot of its dependencies have been rewritten
	- more and more data is available
	- we have developed street network simplification algo
	- we can scale potentially indefinitely - on a single computer
	- this talk outlines the principles of urban morphometrics and ways of scaling the analysis from neighbourhoods to continents -->

### We can measure potentially hundreds of morphometric characters

- dimension
- shape
- spatial distribution

::: {.column width="50%" .incremental}
- intensity
- diversity
- connectivity

### We can measure them at scale
